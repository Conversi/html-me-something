          <p>I don't know if its depression or what.  I'm just not feeling it. I just don't want 
                to create any content. I want to arrange and I know this is my time to show what I can do. And I <strong>can do</strong>.
            Perhaps I'm afraid. Either way this <strong>is</strong> a <em>story</em>. </p><br>

          <p> Normaly an assignment such as this is, to me, an opportunity to show off. A chance to show how well 
                I can write and design. Meh.</p><br>

          <p>I've decided to implement this assignment in it's minimalist state. I will meet the requirements of the 
                assignment.</p>
                <p>-Edit 9/16/2018 15:39 local</p>
                <p>I've made a wiser decision at this late date. I will make this the web site for my new business: Stay-At-Home Productions.  This rant is a placeholder.</p>
